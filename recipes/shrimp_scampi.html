    <h4>Instructions on how to make Shrimp Scampi</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Fire up a pot of water with a generous sprinkle of salt - make it dance with flavor!</li>
        <li>Toss in that linguine and let it boogie in the boiling water for 6 to 8 minutes until it's almost tender. Drain the water, bid it farewell.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a spacious skillet - let the butter and oil become best pals over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Introduce the shallots, garlic, and a hint of red pepper flakes to the sizzling party. Let them mingle until the shallots shimmer like disco lights - around 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, it's showtime for the shrimp! Season them with a dash of kosher salt and a sprinkle of black pepper. Toss them into the spotlight, cook until they turn pink - about 2 to 3 minutes. Give them a round of applause, then let them bask in the warmth.</li>
        <li>Pour in the white wine and lemon juice, let the flavors waltz in the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to serenade the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Melt another 2 tablespoons of butter in the mix, stir in 2 tablespoons of olive oil - let the rich concoction simmer and shimmy.</li>
        <li>Time for the grand finale! Toss the linguine, shrimp, and a shower of parsley into the buttery spectacle. Coat them in the glorious mixture, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and black pepper for that extra pizzazz. To finish, give it a drizzle of 1 teaspoon of olive oil - a star-studded performance awaits!</li>
        <li>Serve hot, and let the flavors dance on your taste buds! Enjoy the culinary extravaganza!</li>
